Hello! I am a political scientist whose research interests lie at the intersection between political behaviour, comparative politics and research methods. My research focuses on questions of individual preference formation, political representation, and mass-elite linkages, with a particular emphasis on immigration - a highly divisive issue in many European countries. My work has been published in leading international political science journals, including the European Journal of Political Research, West European Politics, Government and Opposition, Party Politics, or the Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties.

I am currently a Ramón y Cajal Fellow (tenure-track assistant professor equivalent) at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Previously, I held positions as María Zambrano Postdoctoral Fellow at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (2022-2024), Research Fellow at the European University Institute (2020-2022), and [Max Weber Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/max-weber-programme-for-postdoctoral-studies) at the European University Institute (2018-2020). I earned my PhD in Political and Social Sciences from Universitat Pompeu Fabra in November 2018.
