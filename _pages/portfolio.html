<p>One broad line of my research investigates the drivers and consequences of <b>political partiesâ€™ responsiveness to voters</b> on the cultural dimension of political conflict, particularly in relation to the core issue of immigration. In this research I also touch upon party competition issues and broader dynamics of political representation.<p>

<p>A second line focuses on the formation and change of <b>political preferences and attitudes</b>. I am particularly interested in how political parties, policies, institutions and regimes shape public opinion about immigration, democratic governance, international cooperation and other issues.<p>
