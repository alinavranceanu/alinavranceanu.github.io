One broad line of my research investigates the drivers and consequences of **political partiesâ€™ responsiveness to voters** on the cultural dimension of political conflict, particularly on the core issue of immigration. In this research I also touch upon party competition issues and broader dynamics of political representation.

A second line focuses on the formation and change of **political preferences and attitudes**. I am particularly interested in how political parties, policies, institutions and regimes shape public opinion about immigration, democratic governance, international cooperation and other issues.
